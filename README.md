# Maven Katas

In order to run and perform the following exercises, you need to have at least jdk 11 installed.

## Installing Java
You can use SDKMAN to install a suitable JDK version

## Learning Path
Setup
* [maven-wrapper](setup/README.md) - Use the maven wrapper (added bonus with SDKMAN)  to ensure that the correct maven version is used
* [Dependencies](dependencies/README.md) - Add new dependencies, modify versions or even manage dependencies in a better way
* Multi Module - Work with multi module projects, building sub modules independently or from a parent
* Publish artifacts - Publish artifacts to your local repository. This will be the step previous to publishing in a remote repository (out of scope here)
